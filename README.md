# Mobile Cloud Computing Task Scheduler
An efficient task scheduling framework for mobile cloud computing environments, focusing on energy efficiency and performance under hard deadlines.

## Features
- Energy-efficient task scheduling
- Supports heterogeneous cores and cloud offloading
- Simulation results demonstrate significant energy savings

## Background
Mobile devices often face challenges like limited computing resources and short battery life. This project leverages Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) to offload tasks to the cloud, ensuring performance improvement and energy efficiency.

## How It Works
The scheduler minimizes application completion time and energy consumption by:
- Determining tasks for cloud offloading
- Mapping tasks to heterogeneous cores
- Scheduling tasks while maintaining precedence and deadline constraints

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/MobileCloudComputing-Task-Scheduler.git
   cd MobileCloudComputing-Task-Scheduler
   make prepare
